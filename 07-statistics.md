## <a name="section-a"></a>1.  Introduction

[<img src="img/think_stats.jpg" title="Think Stats"/>](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/)

Use Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) book for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. This book is available online, or you can buy a paper copy if you would like.

Use this book as a reference when answering the 6 required statistics questions below.  The Think Stats book is approximately 200 pages in length.  **It is recommended that you read the entire book, particularly if you are less familiar with introductory statistical concepts.**

Complete the following exercises along with the questions in this file. Some can be solved using code provided with the book. The preface of Think Stats [explains](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2001.html#toc2) how to use the code.  

Communicate the problem, how you solved it, and the solution, within each of the following [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files. (You can include code blocks and images within markdown.)

## <a name="section-b"></a>2.  Why We Are Using Think Stats

The stats exercises have been chosen to introduce/solidify some relevant statistical concepts related to data science.  The solutions for these exercises are available in the [ThinkStats repository on GitHub](https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2).  You should focus on understanding the statistical concepts, python programming and interpreting the results.  If you are stuck, review the solutions and recode the python in a way that is more understandable to you.

For example, in the first exercise, the author has already written a function to compute Cohen's D.  **You could import it, or you could write your own code to practice python and develop a deeper understanding of the concept.**

Think Stats uses a higher degree of python complexity from the python tutorials and introductions to python concepts, and that is intentional to prepare you for the bootcamp.  

**One of the skills to learn here is to understand other people’s code.  And this author is quite experienced, so it’s good to learn how functions and imports work.**

## <a name="section-d"></a>4.  Required Exercises

*Include your Python code, results and explanation (where applicable).*

### Q1. [Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](statistics/2-4-cohens_d.md) (effect size of Cohen's d)  
*Cohen's D is an example of effect size.  Other examples of effect size are:  correlation between two variables, mean difference, regression coefficients and standardized test statistics such as: t, Z, F, etc. In this example, you will compute Cohen's D to quantify (or measure) the difference between two groups of data.*   

*You will see effect size again and again in results of algorithms that are run in data science.  For instance, in the bootcamp, when you run a regression analysis, you will recognize the t-statistic as an example of effect size.*

**My response**

Using the built-in function provided by Allen in his `thinkstat2` module, we compute:
  ```Python3
CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)  
-0.088672927072602006
```
Cohen's d for the difference in pregnancy lengths was:
```Python3
CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngth)
0.028879044654449883
```
The effect of birth order on baby weight is larger than for pregnancy length, but it is still a small effect. (According to Cohen and [Sawilowsky](https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/jmasm/vol8/iss2/26/), a *d* on the order of 0.01 is 'very small' and 0.20 is 'small').



### Q2. [Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](statistics/3-1-actual_biased.md) (actual vs. biased)
*This problem presents a robust example of actual vs biased data.  As a data scientist, it will be important to examine not only the data that is available, but also the data that may be missing but highly relevant.  You will see how the absence of this relevant data will bias a dataset, its distribution, and ultimately, its statistical interpretation.*

**My response:**

Construct the PMF for the actual number of children per family:
```
actual_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(resp.numkdhh, label='actual')
```
Use the provided function `BiasPmf` to construct the biased PMF:
```
bias_pmf = BiasPmf(actual_pmf, label='bias')
```
Overlay histograms of the two PMFs:
```
thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.Pmfs([actual_pmf, bias_pmf])
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='# children in family', ylabel='probability')
```
![Image of plot](https://github.com/kbfreder/dsp/blob/master/statistics/3-1-fig.png)

We expect the PMFs to align for n=1 children.


The actual vs biased means:
```
print('Actual mean: %.2f' % (actual_pmf.Mean()))
print('Biased mean: %.2f' % (bias_pmf.Mean()))

Actual mean: 1.02
Biased mean: 2.40
```


### Q3. [Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](statistics/4-2-random_dist.md) (random distribution)  
*This questions asks you to examine the function that produces random numbers.  Is it really random?  A good way to test that is to examine the pmf and cdf of the list of random numbers and visualize the distribution.  If you're not sure what pmf is, read more about it in Chapter 3.*

**My response:**

```
import numpy as np

sample2 = np.random.random(1000)
samp2_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample2)

thinkplot.Pmf(samp2_pmf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='value', ylabel='PMF',
                 axis = [-0.1, 1.1, 0, 0.01])
```

![PMF Figure](4-2-PMF_Fig.png)

The PMF looks like a block. We would expect a uniform distribution to yield a step function for its PMF. However, note that the probabilities are extremely low because of the large number of values (1000) in our dataset; the maximum probability is only 0.001.

The CDF yields a better way to examine a uniform distribution for large number of values:

```
samp2_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample2)

thinkplot.Cdf(samp2_cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='value', ylabel='CDF',
                 axis = [-0.1, 1.1, -0.1, 1.1])
```
![CDF Figure](4-2-CDF_Fig.png)

The CDF is a straight line for uniform distributions. Our random sampling yields a more or less straight line, confirming the proper functioning of `random.random`.



### Q4. [Think Stats Chapter 5 Exercise 1](statistics/5-1-blue_men.md) (normal distribution of blue men)
*This is a classic example of hypothesis testing using the normal distribution.  The effect size used here is the Z-statistic*

**My response**:

Generate an analytic normal distribution using the mean (178 cm) and standard deviation (7.7) of male heights:
```Python
import scipy.stats as stats

dist = stats.norm(loc=178, scale=7.7)
```
The percent of men between 5'10" and 6'1" is equal to the difference in the evaluation of the CDF at these values:
```Python
# convert heights to centimeters:
blue_min_ht = (5*12 + 10) * 2.54   
blue_max_ht = (6*12 + 1) * 2.54

dist.cdf(blue_max_ht) - dist.cdf(blue_min_ht)
0.34274683763147457
```
34% of men fall in this height range.


### Q5. Bayesian (Elvis Presley twin)

*Bayes' Theorem is an important tool in understanding what we really know, given evidence of other information we have, in a quantitative way.  It helps incorporate conditional probabilities into our conclusions.*

*Elvis Presley had a twin brother who died at birth.  What is the probability that Elvis was an identical twin? Assume we observe the following probabilities in the population: fraternal twin is 1/125 and identical twin is 1/300.*  

**My response:**

Bayes' Theorem states:

P(A|B) = (P(B|A)/P(B)) x P(A)

Or, in words: the posterior probability P(A|B) is equal to the prior probability P(A) times the likelihood ratio P(B|A)/P(B).


We want to find P(A|B) = Elvis had an identical twin, given that he had a male twin.
- P(A) = Elvis had an identical twin = 1/300
- P(B) = Elvis had a male twin = sum of:
  - Probability of fraternal male twin =  1/125 x 0.5 = 1/250
  - Probability of identical male twin =  1/300
  - sum = 11/1500
- P(B|A) = the probability that Elvis had a male twin, given that he had an identical twin = 1

Thus:

P(A|B) = 1/(11/1500) x 1/300 = 1500/11 x 1/300 = 5/11 = 45.4%

### Q6. Bayesian &amp; Frequentist Comparison  
*How do frequentist and Bayesian statistics compare?*

Frequentist:
- The data are random.
- Parameters are fixed; they are presented with confidence intervals.
  - probability of the data, given the null hypothesis (H0)




Bayesian stats:
- The data are fixed.
- Parameters are random; they are presented with probability intervals.
  - probability of H0 given the data.
- require prior knowledge of the distribution. If not explicitly provided, it must be assumed or estimated. This can be subjective and can impact results

## <a name="section-e"></a>5.  Optional Exercises

The following exercises are optional, but we highly encourage you to complete them if you have the time.

### Q7. [Think Stats Chapter 7 Exercise 1](statistics/7-1-weight_vs_age.md) (correlation of weight vs. age)
*In this exercise, you will compute the effect size of correlation.  Correlation measures the relationship of two variables, and data science is about exploring relationships in data.*   

### Q8. [Think Stats Chapter 8 Exercise 2](statistics/8-2-sampling_dist.md) (sampling distribution)
*In the theoretical world, all data related to an experiment or a scientific problem would be available.  In the real world, some subset of that data is available.  This exercise asks you to take samples from an exponential distribution and examine how the standard error and confidence intervals vary with the sample size.*

### Q9. [Think Stats Chapter 6 Exercise 1](statistics/6-1-household_income.md) (skewness of household income)

**The Problem**

Compute the median, mean, skewness and Pearson’s skewness of the [Interpolated] sample. What fraction of households reports a taxable income below the mean? How do the results depend on the assumed upper bound?

**My Answer**
```Python
# load modules and data
import thinkstats2
import numpy as np
import hinc

income_df = hinc.ReadData()
log_sample = InterpolateSample(income_df, log_upper=6.0)
sample = np.power(10, log_sample)
cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample)

# Compute statistics
sample.mean(), np.median(sample)
(74278.707531187203, 51226.933065623722)

thinkstats2.Skewness(sample), thinkstats2.PearsonMedianSkewness(sample)
(4.9499202444295829, 0.7361258019141782)

# Fraction of household with income below mean:
cdf[sample.mean()]
0.66000587956687196
```
The assumed upper-bound will impact the mean, standard deviation, and skew. For example, let's re-compute the sample with a higher upper-bound, e.g. 10 million:
```Python
new_log_sample = InterpolateSample(income_df, log_upper = 7.0)
new_sample = np.power(10, new_log_sample)
new_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(new_sample)

thinkstats2.PearsonMedianSkewness(new_sample), thinkstats2.PearsonMedianSkewness(sample)
(0.39156450927742087, 0.7361258019141782)

new_sample.mean(), sample.mean()
(124267.39722164697, 74278.707531187203)

np.std(new_sample), np.std(sample)
(559608.50137434725, 93946.929963478353)

np.median(new_sample), np.median(sample)
(51226.933065623722, 51226.933065623722)

```

The skew is actually reduced in our higher-upper-bound sample. While the mean is higher (by 3-fold), the standard deviation is also higher (by 5-fold). (The medians are the same.)
