[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

This questions asks you to examine the function that produces random numbers. Is it really random? A good way to test that is to examine the pmf and cdf of the list of random numbers and visualize the distribution. If you're not sure what pmf is, read more about it in Chapter 3.

### The Problem
*The numbers generated by `random.random` are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability.
Generate 1000 numbers from `random.random` and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?*

### The Solution
```
import numpy as np
sample2 = np.random.random(1000)
samp2_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(sample2)
thinkplot.Pmf(samp2_pmf)
```

The PMF is so uniform that it appears like a block. However, it is hard to see this. Also, the probabilities are extremely low; note that the y-axis maximum is only 0.001.

The CDF yields a better way to examine a uniform distribution:

```
samp2_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample2)
thinkplot.Cdf(samp2_cdf)
```

The CDF is a straight line for uniform distributions.
