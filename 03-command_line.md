# Learn command line

Please follow and complete the free online [Bash Scripting Tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/) or [Codecademy's Learn the Command Line](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line). These are helpful tutorials. You should be able to go through these in a couple of hours.

**Note:** Bash is not installed on a PC. Rather, PC users must install Cygwin. Once Cygwin has been installed, the command line interface witll _emulate_ bash. You can find all information regarding Cygwin [here](https://www.cygwin.com/).

* touch <filename>: creating a file using `touch` command
* rm: deleting a file
* mv <old name> <new name>: renaming a file
